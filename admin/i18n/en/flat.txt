See e.g. <a href="https://www.gehrig.info/alexa/Alexa.html" target="_blank">here</a> how to get a cookie manually or try the proxy mode of the adapter! See Error message in log for proxy URL

If the automatic determination of a cookie is not able the adapter opens a proxy to allow a manual login to amazon. The Logfile will tell you the URL to use then. Open this in your browser, manually login into Amazon, solve all potential Captchas or Two-Factor-Authentications and the cookie is catched in the background automatically if successfull.
